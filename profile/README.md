## üìù Project Overview

Pharos AI is developing an autonomous threat detection and response platform that combines:
- **AI-Powered Detection**: YOLOv8-based weapon detection with 95%+ accuracy
- **Edge Processing**: Real-time inference on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (67 TOPS)
- **Drone Swarms**: Coordinated autonomous response with PX4/MAVLink integration
- **Zero-Latency Response**: 1.8-second detection to 12-second drone deployment

### The Problem We're Solving
- Traditional security response time: 3-5 seconds (human reaction)
- Butler PA incident (July 13, 2024): 8+ minute response time, 142-yard blind spot
- Current systems: 60%+ false positives, disconnected response protocols

### Our Solution
- **1.8-second weapon detection** (266% faster than humans)
- **360¬∞ overwatch formation** deployment in 12 seconds
- **<5% false positive rate** with 95%+ detection accuracy
- **45+ minute flight time** per drone with intelligent swarm coordination
